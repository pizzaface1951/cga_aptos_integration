The scope of this repository is to establish a way to integrate parts of the aptos ecosystem with Cross Metaverse Avatars.
As described in the name of CMA (Cross Metaverse Avatars) we are intending to provide access to Avatars and Avatar Wearables.
A Portion of this technology is allowing users to own their own avatars and wearables. This is where Aptos comes in. 
We pair on Aptos chain NFTs with 3d models/Assets/Avatars/Wearables. 
Users can pair their Aptos wallets with CMA to establish what assets the users owns on the CMA ecosystem.
